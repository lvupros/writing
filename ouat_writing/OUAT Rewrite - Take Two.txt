New Characters

King George - Father of King Leopold. 
(character St. George is based off of.)

Rothbart - The Great Animal (a shapeshifter that ages slowly because of its abilities). Rothbart's parents, the rulers of a small kingdom, were slaughtered by soldiers of King George, Snow White's grandfather. He was adopted by a dragoness named Albinia who raised him along side her daughter, Benicia. Albinia raised him to forget his hatred towards humans. He married another dragoness named Simin and they had a daughter named Odile. After the murders of Albinia and Bianca, his hatred for humans returned tenfold. He trusted only Bridgette, a human who served Simin. He wants to completely wipe out King George's family line and return the lands to the proper owners.



Albinia - Dragoness. She found Rothbart hidden away and took him as her own. Shortly afterwards, her own daughter Benicia was hatched. She was murdered by King Stefan's soldiers.



Benicia - Dragoness (white). After her mother and sister-in-law's murders, she hates humans and swears to avenge them. Her anger changes her scales from white to black and she takes on the name Maleficent. She also casts a Sleeping Curse on Briar Rose.



Simin - Dragoness (silver). Rothbart's wife and Odile's mother. Murdered by King Leopold's men. 



Odile - Shapeshifter (swan). Because she is a shapeshifter and Rothbart's daughter, she was once hunted as a child. She sought shelter with the Dark One. She struck a deal with him: shelter for anything he wants from her father. The Dark One chose to take her as an apprentice. However, as a gentle soul, she hated Dark Magic even though she excelled at it. Her father was enormously proud and excited for her skills could allow him to take back his kingdom. Rumplestiltskin opened up frequently to her because she reminded him of his son. Eventually, he decided she was too soft to cast the Dark Curse and stopped training her at her wish. He also helped her give longevity to Bridgette with a spell - some of her longevity would be passed to Bridgette and should she die, so would Bridgette. She meets Neal and falls in love with him because of their similar experiences. She is blackmailed into doing everything her father commands because he possesses Bridgette's heart. She wants to go back in time and prevent her mother and grandmother's death so her father will never become dark.



Bridgette - Human (elderly). She was lady-in-waiting to Simin and becomes Odile's nursemaid. After Simin's death, she is the closest thing Odile has to a mother. Descendent of the seer who predicted Rumplestiltskinâ€™s fate. She tells Odile the prophecy of the Last Author, a servant of Merlin. 

The Last Author (Henry) - The Author is said to have a heart of gold and to have been raised in perfect harmony with darkness and light. As the last Author, he would have the ability to alter reality and time itself.
